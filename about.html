        <p>Hey there! My name is Jorenne Flores. I was born in the Philippines, raised in the Bay Area, and now reside in San Diego.
        <br><br>I'm a Cognitive Science major specializing in Human-Computer Interaction and minoring in Computer Science at U.C. San Diego. I expect to graduate in June 2018. 
        <br><br>I'm interested in user experience, design, web development, computer graphics, and animation, and I'm currently looking for full-time opportunities in San Diego (or anywhere really) that are focusing on those areas. If you're looking for interns in those fields and you're located in San Diego, feel free to contact me about that as well! My other hobbies include dancing, film making, and watching musicals. I also love learning new skills and creating things with them!
        <br><br>Check out some of my links above! You can also contact me through email at <a href="mailto:jorennejf@gmail.com">jorennejf@gmail.com</a>. Thanks for visiting!</p>

        <p>FAQS
          <br><br>When did you first start coding?
          <br><br>If you consider HTML coding, then I bolded and italicized text on my MySpace profile when I was in middle school. I officially taught myself JavaScript online when I was 17.

          <br><br>What are some non-technical skills you're proud of?
          <br><br>Let's see...I taught myself how to juggle one boring summer. I've memorized about 90 digits of pi using <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDiSYp_51iY">this song</a>. Oh yeah, I also have a motorcycle license (but I don't have a motorcycle yet).

          <br><br>What's your favorite font?
          <br><br>Hmmm...serif or sans-serif? I'll just say for serif I like Adobe Caslon Pro and for sans-serif I like Myriad Pro Light Semi Extended.

          <br><br>What's your favorite color?
          <br><br>I like #00FF00 :)

          <br><br>What do you do in your free time?
          <br><br>Outside of school, I like to dance. I'm currently in an all-womxn competitive dance team at my university called 4N01. Check us out <a href="https://www.facebook.com/FourNoOne/">here</a>! I also LOVE musicals. I try to use my UCSD discount to see them at the San Diego Civic Theatre whenever I can. I really love sweets and crave them practically every day, so I sometimes go out for desserts with friends. Also, I have two cats in my apartment, and I spend a lot of time bothering them.

          <br><br>When is your birthday?
          <br><br>My birthday is on October 2nd. 

          <br><br>Can I contact you to collaborate on a project?
          <br><br>Sure! The best way to contact me is through <a href="mailto:jorennejf@gmail.com">email</a>.
