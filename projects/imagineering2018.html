          <h3>Story</h3>
          <p>Stellarium is a reimagining of the abandoned Starlight Bowl at Balboa Park in San Diego. The entire area was transformed into one big garden, complete with a floating hedge maze, lantern lit steps, and comfortable star pods to lounge in.</p>
          <p>This project was a part of <a target="_blank" href="https://disneyimaginations.com">Walt Disney's Imaginations Competition</a>. The theme for this year was abandoned places. The other members of my team include Connie Guan, Amberly Ngo, and Celine Wong.</p>

          <h2>Design Process</h2>
          <br />
          <ol>
            <h3>Ideate</h3>
            <li>We each did separate research on abandoned places that we could possibly use for this project. About half of the process was discussing these places and any ideas that could work with them at each of our meetings. However, we ended up choosing a last-minute option, the Starlight Bowl.</li>

            <br />

            <li>Now that we had a place to reimagine, we brainstormed possible ways to revitalize the area. We found our inspiration through looking at photos and ended up going for a sunken garden while still keeping the star theme.</li>

            <br />

            <h3 class="ol">Create</h3>
            <li>Once an idea was decided, we separated the team into different roles depending on our skills. Two people were left to do the concept art, one person did the story and logo, and I started working on the 3D models.</li>

            <br />

            <li>After I finished the 3D models, we wanted a way to showcase them. We decided to create a video with different clips of the models. Additionally, we wanted to use the video to tell our story, so a teammate and I got to work on an animation.</li>

            <br />

            <li>Once all the content was finished, we had to put them all together in a slide deck of only a maximum of 8 slides. We spent a lot of time trying to figure out what goes where on each slide and added extra things on the slides (like the minimap on the top corner).</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Not gonna lie, I wanted to be an imagineer when I was younger! This project was a lot of work, but I'm really proud of the result. We didn't make it to finals, but I'm glad to have had this experience making something creative with my friends.</p>
          <p align="center">Below is our final submission into the competition:</p>
