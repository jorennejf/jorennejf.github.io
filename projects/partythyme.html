          <h3>Story</h3>
          <p>In this project, I worked with the owner of Party Thyme Catering to create her a simple website from scratch. Along with the website, I created a new logo and brochure menu with the same branding.</p>
          <p>Because this business was not local to my immediate area, we mostly discussed over the phone and online. I gave her all the cost estimates of building and maintaining a website based on her needs before sending her prototypes and developing the site.</p>
        </div>

        <br />

        <div class="process">
          <h2>Design Process</h2>
          <br />
          <ol>
            <h3>Research</h3>
            <li>First, I interviewed my client to get a sense of what she wanted to accomplish with her new website. I wanted to learn more about how she runs her business and where she usually gets her customers from. She also asked if I could create a new menu for her that matches the branding of the site, which she wanted to be simple and modern.</li>

            <br />

            <li>Based on this information, I researched hosting services that gave us what we needed while still keeping costs low. I compiled these cost estimates with costs for purchasing a domain, so that my client could get a sense of her expenses before moving forward.</li>

            <br />

            <h3>Design & Prototype</h3>
            <li>
              With my client on board with the budget, I created the logo and menu. My client only had photos on Facebook, so I worked with those to come up with a menu design.
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12 col-xl-6 center">
                  <div class="caption-top">Light Logo</div>
                  <img src="../assets/images/projects/partythyme-logolight.png" />
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12 col-xl-6 center">
                  <div class="caption-top">Dark Logo</div>
                  <img src="../assets/images/projects/partythyme-logodark.png" />
                </div>

              Click <a target="_blank" href="../assets/images/projects/partythyme-menu.pdf">here</a> to view the final menu!
            </li>

            <br />

            <li>
              Next, I drew out a wireframe of the site on mobile and desktop. Using a content-first approach, I decided to lay each section all out in a single page. Every section is short and to the point, starting with background information of the business and ending with a contact form to request catering orders.
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12 col-xl-6 center">
                  <div class="caption-top">Mobile Wireframe</div>
                  <img src="../assets/images/projects/partythyme-sketch4.jpg" />
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12 col-xl-6 center">
                  <div class="caption-top">Desktop Wireframe</div>
                  <img src="../assets/images/projects/partythyme-sketch1.jpg" />
                </div>
              </div>
            </li>

            <br />

            <li>
              With my sketches, I produced a high resolution digital prototype. I sent this and the menu design to my client, so she can get a good sense of the final product.
              <div class="row">
                <div class="col-md-12 col-xl-5 center">
                  <div class="caption-top">Mobile Prototype</div>
                  <img src="../assets/images/projects/partythyme-mobile.jpg" />
                </div>
                <div class="col-md-12 col-xl-7 center">
                  <div class="caption-top">Desktop Prototype</div>
                  <img src="../assets/images/projects/partythyme-desktop.jpg" />
                </div>
              </div>
            </li>

            <br />

            <li>Upon seeing the prototypes, my client was very pleased with the progress so far. However, there were some small changes. She no longer worked with her baker, so I had to remove anything involving desserts and update the logo. She also wanted to include her promotions. I decided to incorporate these changes in the development phase.</li>

            <br />

            <h3>Develop</h3>
            <li>Since I used a simple, linear navigation flow, I developed the site mobile-first and easily made it responsive. This also helped me keep the site looking simple, so that users would enjoy looking through the site no matter what device they're viewing it on.</li>

          </ol>
        </div>

        <br />

        <div class="conclusion">
          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>This was the first time I have worked on a website from scratch all on my own. It was simple enough for me to not need help, but challenging enough for me to learn new things (e.g. web hosting, utilizing PHP). In the end, however, my client's career goals changed, and she decided to close her catering business to work as a private chef for another company. Maybe we can launch this website for her some other time, but I am now familiar with the entire process of creating a website for any future clients!</p>
