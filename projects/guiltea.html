				<h2>About</h2>
        <p>In this project, our team worked with the owner of Guiltea Cravings to recreate their website. Guiltea Cravings is a boba shop that also sells other drinks, appetizers, and desserts. We met with the client every 2-3 weeks to update him on the progress of the site. We performed interviews, competitive analysis, and prototyping before beginning development on the site.</p>
        <p>This project was a part of COGS 187B: Practicum in Professional Web Design, where we worked with a client to remake their business's website. The other members of my team include Joanne Cho, Judd Gatbonton, and Charity Shin.</p>

        <h2>Design Process</h2>
        <ol>
          <br />
          <h3 class="ol">Research</h3>
          <li>The first thing we had to do was meet with the client and get some information about his business. We interviewed him on what the shop is all about, what he wanted to include in the new website, and who his customers usually tend to be. He said he wanted a new website that's more modern and minimalistic than his old one.</li>

          <br />

          <li>We then looked at Guiltea Cravings' current site (both on desktop and mobile) and evaluated its design and content.</li>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-2">
              <img src="../assets/images/projects/guilteaold-home.gif" class="single-vert" />
            </div>
            <div class="caption caption-right col-md-4 col-lg-6 col-xl-8">
              The old site's homepage was full of so many things, some of which don't even work. This layout causes users to scroll through a lot, especially on mobile.
            </div>
          </div>

          <img src="../assets/images/projects/guilteaold-menu.png" class="single-photo" />
          <div class="caption">The signature items section on the old site only had one item on it, taking up the entire width of the screen. The rest of the items didn't seem to even load.</div><br />

          <img src="../assets/images/projects/guilteaold-cater.png" class="single-photo" />
          <div class="caption">Images on the old site were so large they take up almost everything above the fold, making users scroll to get to the content. The navigation bar is also inconsistent throughout the site.</div>

          <br />

          <div class="caption">Click <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gLeR4vYimWA7w3hIPbMpfsvKPPmgBLNcg1JtFbeqthc/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> to view our client proposal!</div>

          <br />

          <li>Next, we conducted user interviews both onsite at Guiltea Cravings and offsite on the phone or at a different location. Our interviewees varied from students to professionals to parents. From these interviews, we came up with user personas to guide us through the rest of the website's development.</li>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-12 col-xl-6">
              <img src="../assets/images/projects/guiltea-persona1.png" class="single-photo" />
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12 col-xl-6">
              <img src="../assets/images/projects/guiltea-persona2.png" class="single-photo" />
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12 col-xl-6 offset-xl-3">
              <img src="../assets/images/projects/guiltea-persona3.png" class="single-photo" />

          <br />

          <li>For our competitive analysis, we looked at Kung Fu Tea, Square Bar, Tastea, and Boba Guys. Our goal with competitive analysis was to find things that we liked on other sites. At the same time, we also created mood boards to get a feel for what kind of site we wanted to create.</li><br />

          <br />

          <h3 class="ol">Prototype</h3>
          <li>Our team then created wireframes of all the pages we wanted to create, both on desktop and mobile. We linked all these pages into an interactive prototype using InVision.</li>

          <div class="row align-items-center">
            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-4 col-xl-4">
              <img src="../assets/images/projects/guiltea-wireframe1.png" class="single-vert" style="height: 300px" />
            </div>
            <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-7 col-xl-7">
              <img src="../assets/images/projects/guiltea-wireframe2.png" class="single-photo" />
            </div>
          </div>

          <div class="caption">Click <a target="_blank" href="https://invis.io/E9FWQZBGK3D">here</a> to view our mobile prototype and <a target="_blank" href="https://invis.io/KMFWVW04AUX">here</a> to view our desktop prototype!</div>

          <br />

          <h3 class="ol">Develop</h3>
          <li>Finally, we began development of the actual site. Most of the layout followed our wireframes, but in the end, we changed a few things based on feedback from instructors and peers.</li>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="caption caption-left col-md-6 col-lg-7 col-xl-8">Our goal with the homepage was to declutter the layout and give users an idea of what the shop is all about. We did this by simplifying the homepage and making the brand cuter and friendlier.</div>
            <div class="col-md-6 col-lg-5 col-xl-4">
              <img src="../assets/images/projects/guiltea-home.gif" class="single-vert" />
            </div>
          </div>

          <img src="../assets/images/projects/guiltea-menu1.png" class="single-photo" />
          <div class="caption">We included a signature items section on the menu to fulfill one of our persona's needs of getting item recommendations.</div><br />

          <img src="../assets/images/projects/guiltea-menu2.png" class="single-photo" />
          <div class="caption">We also included new images of the shop's menu so users can see more of the items available.</div>

        </ol>
      </div>

      <br />

      <div class="content">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I'm pretty happy with the end result of this site, and our client seemed satisfied with our work so far. We plan to meet up with him one more time to get his site live on his business's domain. The whole process involved in this project was a lot of work, but I guess that's expected of a quarter-long project.</p>
